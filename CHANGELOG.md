# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Added `VertexPassFn` and `custom_vertex_pass` support to enable parallelized/accelerated interpolation fitting.
- Added support for custom vertex pass callbacks to all adapters (`Batch`, `Streaming`, `Online`).
- Added support for custom parallel/accelerated standard error calculation via `custom_interval_pass`.
- Added `KDTreeBuilderFn` and `custom_kdtree_builder` hook to enable external parallel KD-tree construction.
- Added `KDTree::from_parts` and exposed `KDNode` and `KDTree::calculate_left_subtree_size` to support custom tree building.
- Added neighborhood caching in `InterpolationSurface` to significantly optimize performance during robustness iterations.

### Changed

- Changed license from AGPL-3.0-or-later to dual MIT OR Apache-2.0.
- Expanded `SmoothPassFn`, `CVPassFn`, and `IntervalPassFn` signatures to include full multi-dimensional context (dimensions, scaling, polynomial degree, etc.).
- Improved data propagation in `InterpolationSurface` to ensure all necessary coordinate and value slices are available to custom pass implementations.
- Updated `LoessExecutor` to correctly handle augmented data when switching between direct and interpolation modes.
- Updated `InterpolationSurface::build` to accept and propagate `polynomial_degree`, `weight_function`, `zero_weight_fallback`, `distance_metric`, and `scales` for `custom_vertex_pass`. Also, updated `LoessExecutor` to pass these configured values correctly.
- Improved documentation.

### Fixed

- Fixed a potential crash in parallel interpolation refinement by correctly propagating augmented data slices to vertex fitting functions.
- Fixed inconsistent parameter types in custom pass callbacks.
- Fixed missing setters for online and streaming adapters.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release.
